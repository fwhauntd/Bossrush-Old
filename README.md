Old Bossrush (Legacy Version) for Shadows of Evil

Old Bossrush (Legacy Version) Setup & Run Guide ‚Äì Shadows of Evil

This guide covers the old version of the Bossrush mod for Shadows of Evil, which allows players to leave the Pack-a-Punch room. This version lets you:

  - Open all breakable doors, enabling faster routes and better times.

    - Call the tram to specific locations (some of which are faster).

      - Change rounds to regain Beast Modes.

These features are not available in the newer version of Bossrush.

üõ†Ô∏è Mod Setup Guide:
Go to "This Pc" open (Your Drive Name)(C:) and then follow this:
  - > Program Files (x86) > Steam > steamapps > common > Call of Duty Black Ops III.
    - > make a file in there called "mods" and extract this file into it. it should say "2372198694" in the folder.
      - > equally if you have it in a different location you do the same guide.
  - > a quicker method is: open steam, right click on "Call of Duty Black Ops III" press manage > browse folder location and continue from making the folder.

üõ†Ô∏è Setup Guide:

  1. Turn around from spawn and run through the top door. Activate Beast Mode, open the doors, and unlock all Rifts.

  2. Head to Nero's Room and interact with the floating book.

  3. Go to the subway and pick up the flag.

  4. Place the flag at the spawn door location.

  5. Return to Nero's Room (either before or after the flag breaks) and start killing zombies there ‚Äî this is done for spawn manipulation.

  6. End the round ‚Äî your Beast Mode will be replenished.

  7. Go to Waterfront and move the tram there.

  8. Use the Rift to return to the Pack-a-Punch room and begin the Boss Fight.



üèÉ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è Run Guide:

  1. Pick up Arnies and equip a light weapon (RK5 or Bloodhound).

  2. Grab Fatal Contraption, pop it next to the Ritual Podium, then run back and pick up Pop Shocks from the Gobblegum machine.

  3. Start the Boss Fight. Use your Arnie, grab the Death Machine, throw your Arnie, and get ready to "kill" the Shadowman.

  4. After "killing" the Shadowman, go through the Canals Rift (bottom right), run to Beast Mode, and become the Beast immediately.

  5. Upon glitching into infinite Beast Mode, shock all three boxes:

        1. Canals: Corner near the tram door at the top of the stairs.

        2. Waterfront: Same place as Canals, just mirrored.

        3. Footlight: In the middle between the doors. You can hit it from the Beast podium if you're angled correctly.

  6. Exit Beast Mode, run up, call the tram, use Pop Shocks to kill the Margwa, and become the Beast again ASAP.

  7. Run to the middle, shock all 3 Keepers, and exit Beast Mode.

  8. The timer stops on the white flash.

This version of Bossrush is only better for Shadows of Evil and possibly Gorod Krovi (though that hasn‚Äôt been fully confirmed yet).

On the other hand, the newer version of Bossrush:
https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1841533045
is better for all other maps.

This version was originally found by JJbros, zTrixS, Luisete2105, and myself. Only a small group of us had access to it, as it was kept within our circle because we were the only ones doing runs. But now, we're making it public so we can finally have some real competition in the speedrunning scene and get the newer players involved and not give up because we had an "unfair advantage".

Thanks for reading.
A Bossrush Timer is currently in development ‚Äî stay tuned.
